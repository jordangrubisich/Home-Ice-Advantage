# Home-Ice-Advantage
This project analyzes 20 years of NHL game data (2000â€“2020) to investigate whether playing on home ice provides teams with a statistically significant advantage. Using hypothesis testing techniques, I evaluate win proportions for home vs. away teams to determine if there is statistical significance to the concept of home ice advantage.
