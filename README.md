# Home-Ice-Advantage
This project analyzes 20 years of NHL game data (2000â€“2020) to investigate whether playing on home ice provides teams with a statistically significant advantage. Using hypothesis testing techniques, I evaluate win proportions for home vs. away teams to determine if there is statistical significance to the concept of home ice advantage.

## Key Features of This Analysis

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of historical NHL game results
- Formulation of null and alternative hypotheses
- Application of z-tests for proportions to test statistical significance
- Documentation of methodology and findings

## Goal
To demonstrate statistical analysis skills in Python by applying real-world data to answer a well-defined research question in sports analytics.
